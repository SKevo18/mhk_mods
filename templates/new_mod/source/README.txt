Copy modified game assets from `./sources/decompiled` into this directory.

Make sure the directory structure stays the same!
E. g.: `sources/decompiled/mhk_3/Moorhuhnkart/musics/menu.ogg` goes into `<this mod dir>/source/Moorhuhnkart/musics/menu.ogg`,
if you are creating a mod for Moorhuhn Kart 3.

IMPORTANT:

- [!] Do not copy all game assets into this directory, only include files that are modified!
- [!] Remove this file when you are done and the mod is ready to pack!
