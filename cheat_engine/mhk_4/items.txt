Empty = 4294967295 # NOTE: Or any other value, see # INFO section at the very bottom of this file.

# Normal:
Speed = 0
Oil = 1
Shield/Bubble = 2
Rocket = 3
Fake Item Box = 4
Freeze = 5

# Versus/Battle Mode:
# NOTE: In normal race, the items do not appear in the item slot, but you can use them.
Health Increase = 6             # NOTE: Seemingly useless in normal races, as there is no health bar.
Creepy Ghost Hand Thingy = 7
Hammer = 8                      # NOTE: Does not affect karts in normal races.

# Special:
Feather = 9             # WARNING: Untested, will probably crash too (see down)
Bananas = 10            # NOTE: Surprisingly, this works for any driver (tested with Moorhuhn)
Turbine (3 uses) = 11   # WARNING: Crashes the game if you use it with driver other than Frog - that's because other drivers don't have Frog's jump animation when using it
Turbine (2 uses) = 12   # WARNING: (up)
Turbine (1 use) = 13    # WARNING: (up)
Turtle Shell = 14       # WARNING: (up, except Turtle)
Homing Pumpkin = 15     # WARNING: (up, except Pumpkin)
Electro-ray = 16        # WARNING: (up, :( except Alien)
Mole Hole = 17          # NOTE: Should work for any driver (Moorhuhn tested). Hank coming in contact with the hole doesn't crash the game, since it's possible in two player mode with 2 Hank players.


# INFO:
# Anything else will make your item slot empty (it won't crash, unlike MHK 2). Negative values do not crash the game either.
# Only Bananas (10) and Mole Hole (17) should work for any driver - other special items crash the game when you use them without being the driver that owns them (tested with Moorhuhn)
#
# You can use multiple items of the same type in a row, unlike MHK 3 which only allows you to use 1 item of the same type (the old item will disappear)
# This also means that you can spam the Shield powerup to deep fry your game's music and get that sweet earrape. Not sure why would you do that...
#
# Be careful - turning on "Infinity Item Uses" cheat will once again affect ALL racers and will make the race twice longer. CPUs have basically become your evil friends, and like to spam a lot of items randomly in a perfect row, making the race a lot more difficult!
# Shield will definitely come in handy to bypass all these items. Or, at least your steering skills...
#
# 420 coins costs the most expensive item in the shop (engine).
