# Moorhuhn Kart Cheat Engine Tables

This folder contains my Cheat Engine tables for MHK games.
It also contains standalone executables (currently only for MHK 2), if you don't have Cheat Engine installed:

1. Run game;
2. `Alt + Tab` out/hit `Windows` key/get out of the game somehow;
3. Run the trainer executable;
4. Use numbers above letters (no numpad keys) to toggle mods;

> **Note:** If you modify these tables/use them somewhere, please credit me. Thanks!
