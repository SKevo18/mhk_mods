# Slovak Translation for Moorhuhn Kart 3

> This mod replaces Deutsch language in Moorhuhn Kart 3 with Slovak language

Some diacritics unique to Slovak language do not currently display in the game, so they've been replaced with their "standard" variants (`š => s`, `č => c`, `ť => t`).

## Installation

Replace original data file in game's installation directory with modified `data.sar`
