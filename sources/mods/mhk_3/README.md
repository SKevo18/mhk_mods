## Modding notes

- Texture images are compiled as Microsoft DirectDraw surface files. You can use tools like [Covertio](convertio.co/png-dds/) to convert them;
- Map files (collisions, start positions, meshes) are `.lwo` and `.lso` files - you can open & edit them with NewTek's LightWave 8 - a free version with keygen included is available for download at [Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/lw-8_20200630);
- Music is `.ogg` - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) can create `.ogg` from pretty much anything you throw at it;
